\begin{abstract}
\noindent This thesis solves dynamic portfolio allocation problems with fixed and proportional transaction costs,
and correlated return structures. The model is solved using a combination of dynamic programming (DP), numerical methods and machine learning techniques,
using the most recent advances on solving dynamic portfolio choice problems with proportional transaction costs.
The efficiency of the framework solves problems, which previously were infeasible to solve without the use of super computers.
This thesis contributes to the existing literature in a multitude of ways. Firstly,
I present a novel approach to the fixed costs problem, based on the state of the art framework for proportional costs,
which leverages the geometric shape of the No-Trade Region (NTR), stemming from the trade frictions.
Secondly, this thesis is the first to paper, in my knowledge, to solve dynamic portfolio choice problems with fixed costs for correlated assets, with more than two risky assets.
Thirdly i present an approach to solving new transaction costs structures, not yet considered, and how to adapt my computational approach to these,
paving the way for future research in this area.
