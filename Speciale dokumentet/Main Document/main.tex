\begin{abstract}
\noindent This thesis solves dynamic portfolio allocation problems with fixed and proportional transaction costs
and correlated return structures.
The models are solved using a combination of dynamic programming (DP), numerical methods and machine learning techniques,
using the most recent advances on solving dynamic portfolio choice problems with proportional transaction costs.
This thesis contributes to the existing literature in a multitude of ways. Firstly, I present a novel approach to the fixed costs problem
based on the state of the art framework for proportional costs.
This leverages the geometric shape of the No-Trade Region (NTR) which occurs due to the transaction costs.
Secondly, this thesis is the first, to my knowledge, to solve dynamic portfolio choice problems with fixed costs, correlated returns and more than two risky assets,
providing insight into the shape of the NTR with fixed costs.
Thirdly, I present findings on the combination of fixed and proportional costs and the resulting NTR shape in relation to the two costs.
Lastly, I present an approach to solving new transaction costs structures, not yet considered, and how to adapt my computational approach to these,
paving the way for future research in this area.
