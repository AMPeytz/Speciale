# Dynamic Portfolio Choice Models with Transaction Costs - Masters Thesis in Economics.

### General Overview
This repo contains files for my masters thesis in economics,
which focus on Dynamic Portfolio Choice Models, in the presence of transaction costs.
These models are solved using dynamic programming methods. We use constrained non linear optimization, quadrature and monte carlo methods, gaussian process regression and a problem specific sampling scheme.

This repo contains files regarding the thesis written in LaTeX, and my coding project, in Python.

## Folder Structure

Below is a breakdown of the main folders in the repository and their contents:

- **`src/`**: Contains the main source code for the project, including scripts and modules.
- **`data/`**: This folder holds any datasets used in the project. Large datasets should be linked to an external source.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation and resources for understanding the project and its components.
- **`tests/`**: Test cases and testing scripts to ensure the reliability of the codebase.
- **`results/`**: Stores generated output from computations or model training, if applicable.

(Add additional folders as needed and specify contents.)

## Computational Requirements

To run the code effectively, consider the following requirements:

- **Hardware**: List any specific hardware requirements (e.g., GPU, RAM).
- **Software**: Specify the programming language, version (e.g., Python 3.8), and required libraries.
- **Dependencies**: List the packages required, ideally with version numbers. Alternatively, link to a requirements file if present.
- **Running the Code**: Provide instructions for executing the code, including sample commands and any environment variables that need to be set.

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [Installation Guide](link-to-installation-guide).
